# Goarder (abandoned)

Goarder is an open-source console based RPG scripted entirely in Python that is currently in early alpha. The game is always being developed further, as such I am open to any ideas on what to add next.

If you happen to spot a bug that needs squashing, please let us know, and I'll try to patch it as soon as possible.
